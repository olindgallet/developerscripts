# buildapp (Beta Version, Released 9/1/2017)

Sets up a work directory for a webapp with a Bootstrap, Vue, and Page stack.  Adds in Bower and Grunt for tasks and updates.  Provides directory for development and production; the plan is to use Grunt to take desired files from the development folders, compress and obfuscate them, and put them inproduction.

Notes:

-Hard coded some file creation and tried out downloading some files from Gists.  I noticed that with even one small change the filename for the gist would change.  I wonder if I can use another link, but as of now I need the raw version of the file.

-Currently testing it out by making apps with it.  Never used Vue and Page either, but I chose this stack after looking at the other frameworks in Javascript.  I'll put some apps I'm making in it up also as time progresses.
